# Image Deblurrer Project

## Overview  
This project focuses on restoring sharpness to blurred images using a **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** framework. The **generator** currently uses a **U-Net architecture**, while the **discriminator** is a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Dataset  
The training data consists of images of animals sourced from the [Animals10 dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10).

## Data Preparation  
Blurred images are generated by applying a slight Gaussian blur with `sigma=1` using the `scipy` library to simulate real-world blur.

## Planned Improvements  
- Introduce **perceptual loss** to enhance the quality of generated images.  
- Experiment with different **generator architectures** and compare results:  
  - ResNet50  
  - ResNet101  
  - Various U-Net variants  
  - Variational Autoencoder (VAE)  
- Explore different **discriminator architectures** including:  
  - Conventional CNNs  
  - ResNet50  
  - ResNet101
